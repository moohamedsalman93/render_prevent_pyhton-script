# Website Keepalive Script

This Python script prevents your website hosted on Render from shutting down due to inactivity by periodically sending HTTP requests to it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (installed via `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `keepalive.py` script.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install requests`.
3. Replace `'https://your-website.example.com'` in the script with the actual URL of your website hosted on Render.
4. Run the script using Python: `python keepalive.py`.

The script will continuously send requests to your website every 5 minutes to keep it responsive.

## Configuration

You can adjust the frequency of requests by changing the sleep duration in the script. By default, it's set to 5 minutes (`time.sleep(5 * 60)`).
